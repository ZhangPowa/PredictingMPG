## Background
This summer I have had the luxury of commuting to UCLA twice a week for a total of around 200 miles driven just for school. With my car only having an average of 16.5 mpg and gas prices at an all time high, my gas bill is extremely expensive. There are a lot of different ways I could potentially lower this cost. I can commute using cheaper methods of travel sacrificng comfort and time. I can get a new car with higher mpg. Or simply I can just not attend school. While these options do present a much lower gas bill, I would like to keep my car, learn more about statistics, and travel on my own. Luckily I know statistics, and maybe by understanding which factors are most important in predicting MPG, I can use those factors to change my driving habits and increase my car's average MPG. Through this research process I hope to reduce the money spent on gas while also learning the entire data science process. I will collect and clean my own data, use data analysis to see certain trends in the data, and lastly I will build models to predict MPG.
